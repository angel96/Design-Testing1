There's a new version of the sample workspace, 
the sample project template, the developer's 
virtual machine, and the pre-production virtual 
machine (1.18.1).  

It's strongly recommended that our students 
should download and start using these updates 
since they fix minor problems that might 
otherwise become problematic.

The workspace and the project template are 
available in this folder.  The virtual machines 
are available at 
ftp://practica:practica@coco.lsi.us.es/DT.  
This FTP site will remain open till the end of 
this lesson.
